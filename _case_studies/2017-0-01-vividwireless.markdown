## The Problem

To improve the usability of the website so that people could easily access 4G internet devices in the Web 2.0 era (2011). High growth and expansion plans meant that the company needed a more focused website to meet both its strategic needs and customer needs.

## The Approach

### Goals
The project goals involved balancing both customer and business needs to ensure a good online user experience for the entire customer journey. The core functions of the site (like an online shop and an account section) had already been decided prior to this project. Other than that, we had the freedom to design for a great user experience.

### For customers
* Give people the information and tools they need to make decisions
* Make it easy for people to purchase what's right for them
* As the first of its kind in Australia, address questions around what 4G is

### For the business
* Create a website that works well with campaigns and can be optimised for digital marketing

### Discovery
Through methods like stakeholder workshops, customer workshops, surveys, monitoring forums, social media and feedback from sales and service representatives, we discovered pain points and factors that push a person to search for a new provider. Some factors include: moving houses, not wanting to pay for installation, renting and coming out of a contract.

These insights showed we had to focus on user needs relating to:

* Understanding what they are getting (4G was new at the time)
* Finding out if it's right for them (network coverage was still limited)
* Finding the right device and plan for their circumstances
* Easily purchasing the right device and plan

We then created a sitemap, identified what a user needed at each step of the flow and were ready to begin wireframing.

{% include image.html url="/assets/vwWireframes.jpg" alt="annotated wireframes" %}

### Design and Delivery

We collaborated and designed in rapid cycles, getting feedback as soon as possible. We mapped out user flows, improved information architecture and created wireframes for major sections like the shop. We paid special attention to iteratively designing tools like a plan recommendation widget and a coverage map check.

### User Testing

We collaborated with another agency for expert analysis of our design, user testing and eye tracking analysis. We had 20 people complete tasks, such as find out what plan they should get and observed how they completed their tasks.

Back at the office I also ran a separate user testing workshop on employees, challenging them to use the site with the fresh eyes of a user.

Overall, the users were overwhelmingly able to complete tasks. We also uncovered actionable findings like these:

* **Design for scanning:** Eye tracking analysis showed that people scan for information. Because of this, we designed for scanning with short and impactful headers and distinct card-like blocks.
*  **Increase page-to-page flow:** We observed some users getting confused about how to move to other pages, such as returning to the homepage from the shop section. This led us to provide useful links to all users like a home icon and links to other useful pages in the user flow.

## The Outcome

After the site launch, we experienced an incremental rise in SEO rankings for keywords. Other teams were also able to use parts of the site more in campaigns as landing pages.
