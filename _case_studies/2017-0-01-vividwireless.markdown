## BACKGROUND
My first large task when I joined the vividwireless team was to redesign the website in the Web 2.0 era. The company was the first to offer 4G broadband in Australia had launched about half a year ago. High growth and expansion plans meant that they a more focused website to meet both its strategic needs and customer needs.

### Details
Time: 6 months

Team: Online manager, agencies and myself

Techniques: Stakeholder workshops, User journey mapping, Wireframing, Content Auditing, Card sorting, Eye tracking analysis, User testing, Lean UX

## THE PROBLEM AND OPPORTUNITY
Choosing an Internet provider involves weighing factors like price, speeds, data usage and network across providers. Customers often carry out due diligence in forums, market comparison sites and visting stores.

As a major customer touchpoint, the website was a massive opportunity to simplify this process and help people get connected.

## GOALS
The project goals involved balancing both customer and business needs to ensure a good online user experience for the entire customer journey. The core functions of the site (like an online shop and an account section) had already been decided prior to this project. Other than that, we had the freedom to design for a great user experience.

### For customers
* Give people the information and tools they need to make decisions
* Make it easy for people to purchase what's right for them
* As the first of its kind in Australia, address questions around what 4G is

### For the business
* Create a website that works well with campaigns and can be optimised for digital marketing

## DISCOVER
Through methods like stakeholder workshops, customer workshops, surveys (post-transactional surveys), monitoring forums, social media and feedback from sales and service representatives, we were able to understand pain points and factors that push a person to search for a new provider. Some factors include: moving houses, not wanting to pay for installation, renting and coming out of a contract.

We were provided with customer profile segmensts and combined with data and insight we collected, we pieced together personas like a plan changer who shops around, a renter who is frequently on the move and a frustrated customer who's tired of waiting around.

These insights showed we had to focus on user needs relating to:

* Understanding what they are getting (4G was new at the time)
* Finding out if it's right for them (network coverage was still limited)
* Finding the right device and plan for their circumstances
* Easily purchasing the right device and plan

Using task analysis, we identified what a user needed at each step of the flow and were ready to begin sketching.

## DESIGN

### Lean UX
We collaborated and designed with a lean UX approach, working in rapid cycles and getting feedback as soon as possible. Under this approach, we made assumptions on how a user might use our site and what would help the user most, testing to validate assumptions as we went along.

We worked on mapping out the user flows, information architecture and wireframes for major sections such as the shop section. We paid special attention to iteratively designing the shop section, including designing helpful tools to users like a plan recommendation widget and a coverage map check.

### Card sorting and content audit
We used open card sorting to help us work through organising the site structure, which helped us define the information hierarchy, navigation and content. We did face some challenges with labelling, as people used different terminology.

For the content strategy, we had lots of existing content to audit and new ones to write. A challenge here was making sure that both the business and customers got what they needed from the content.

## TESTING

### User testing, Eye tracking and Expert analysis

We collaborated with another agency for expert analysis of our design, user testing and eye tracking analysis. We had 20 people complete user tasks, such as find out what plan they should get and observed how they completed their tasks.

Back at the office I also ran a separate user testing workshop on employees, challenging them to use the site with the fresh eyes of a user.

Time and budget constraints meant we weren't able to create an interactive prototype, so instead, we tested on the wireframes for the information architecture and the user's mental models.

Overall, the users were overwhelmingly able to complete tasks. We also uncovered actionable findings like these:

### Designing for scanning
Eye tracking analysis showed that people don't read but scan for information. Because of this, we designed for scanning with short and impactful headers and distinct card-like blocks.

### Increasing page-to-page flow
We observed some users getting confused about how to move to other pages, such as returning to the homepage from the shop section. This led us to provide useful links to all users like a home icon and links to other useful pages in the user flow.

## DELIVERY
After design iterations based on our tests, we developed and tested the site in daily scrums. We also enlisted other team members to use the site while in the testing environment to uncover any issues we might have missed (none uncovered by this point).

After the site launch, we experienced an incremental rise in SEO rankings for keywords. Other teams were also able to use parts of the site more in campaigns as landing pages.
