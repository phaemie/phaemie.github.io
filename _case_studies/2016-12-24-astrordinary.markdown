  The Milky Way has inspired humanity for millennia. But today, light pollution means many won't get to see it for themselves.

  Through stunning astrophotography, I helped give people a chance to do so.

## MY ROLE AND THE TEAM

This was a major side project I took on with my brother. I served as a UX and UI designer, in charge of the experience of the site. This included research and design deliverables like mock ups. My brother fulfilled the product manager role and we both performed user testing.

## THE CHALLENGE

The spectacular Milky Way has inspired stories, songs and space exploration for ages. But today's stargazer might find it challenging to even see it in the night sky. Light pollution means that the Milky Way is [shrouded from view](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution "Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas shows") for many people, especially those living in densely populated areas. It's no surprise then that images of the Milky Way resonate.

My brother created Astrordinary in 2015 to photograph and share high-resolution panoramas and VR photospheres of the galaxy and near space as seen from Western Australia. Virtual reality was going mainstream, which enabled him to give people a virtual view of the Milky Way. Many people had never seen anything like it and shared them, as did tourism organisations, photographers and VR apps. The community of ‘earthlings’ soon grew organically, concentrated on a variety of social media.

Apart from viewing images, some had requested to purchase prints and a website with a gallery and online store was setup to quickly meet this demand. I proposed that we work together to build a responsive site that would be a complete experience for users to browse images, easily purchase prints and get more involved in astrophotography.

## THE APPROACH

### Keeping communication open
We were based in different ends of the country, so we made an extra effort to maintain open communication. We caught up via video chat to discuss thoughts, approaches and design critiques approximately once a week. We started in October 2016 with an approximate 4 month target to get the new site up and running.


### The Double Diamond
The _diverge-converge-diverge-converge_ design process and especially the [Revamped Double Diamond](http://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812#.d5zw1tfqi) framework were highly applicable to this project, helping to identify the right thing to design and then designing it right.

### User empathy, VR style
I followed every single post and looked at Astrordinary images using a VR headset. Unfortunately for me, I belong to the third of humanity who can't see the Milky Way in person. But fortunately for this project, I got to experience how VR images of the Milky Way solve my problem.

One other thing I wanted to do was tag along and live witness an astrophotography shoot. But my one and only chance on a short visit to Perth didn’t pan out; the night was cloudy and unsuitable for night photography. Oh well.

## DISCOVERY (Personas, problem framing, empathy with users, emotional states)

{% include image.html caption="Making sense in the discovery phase (lots more like these)" url="/assets/discovery.jpg" alt="Discovery findings" %}

I began researching the user and his/her needs. I explored what the user wanted, investigating areas like emotional states when viewing images and motivators for why people purchased images, sent a message, shared a post and what they did with their purchase. I also looked into how other photographers dealt with strong visual subject matter.

### Structuring findings into themes

I synthesised and evaluated my research into three main themes:

#### 1. Natural beauty that invokes a sense of awe and nostalgia

>_Your moon photo this morning was beautiful. I work on Rous Head & that is exactly how I remember moon sets & moon rises._

>_So humbling to see that in real life..._

>_Really puts things in perspective._

Many expressed appreciation for the raw, natural beauty of the night sky captured in the images. This appreciation stemmed from a personal and highly emotional place. Looking at the magnificent Milky Way images often surfaced a nostalgic memory (such as of childhood and how the sky looked when a person lived at a certain house) or an emotional memory of doing or desire to do something with a loved one. People also were moved by a sense of scale and their place in the universe.

#### 2. Technical learning and craft

>_How did you manage not to have the lines with a 20s pause?_

These images inspired many amateurs and photographers alike to learn more about panoramic techniques, equipment and shooting locations. People were interested in the background of how the images were taken.

#### 3. The images personify a sense of adventure
Many users felt the images captured a 'carpe diem' type of ethos to get out there and experience the world. They mentioned activities like camping, stargazing and road trips. This sense of adventure seemed to have an egalitarian quality about it which the photographer aptly summed up as "The night sky is for all to see". The fact that in reality, many don't get to see the Milky Way where they are is irrelevant to the spirit of adventure. In addition, many people expressed interest in connection, such as meeting up to go on photoshoots.


### Personas

Armed with this discovery, I painted a picture of the user with four personas.

![Personas](/assets/AstroPersonas.jpg)

The Active Learner persona was the main focus in the design. This persona was the most engaged of the four and made up the largest group. On hindsight, I see that the personas could benefit from additional insight and points of view such as making the persona tell its own story through speech bubbles.

## THE DESIGN PROBLEM, REFRAMED

**Create a way that allows a person to experience the night sky and astrophotography.**

Reframing the problem this way enabled us to think critically about the initial goals. It expanded possibilities and set the stage for a delightful and cohesive user experience.

## SKETCHES AND PROTOTYPES

### Creating meaning for the user
The personas played a crucial role in our decisions designing an experience for them. We wanted to give the user what they wanted in the shortest possible time in a way that made the most sense to them. ([No point being different](http://medium.com/@yarcom/in-defense-of-homogeneous-design-b27f79f4bb87#.tbe7ipavg) purely for the sake of being unique.)

We also used the personas to guide us in auditing content and developing new ones. For example, user research showed that a major group of users were keen to learn more about techniques. We discussed win-win solutions that gave users what they want in a way that made business sense. This ultimately resulted in freely sharing information about equipment and developing workshops that interested users could sign up to.

We tossed around a few user journeys and ultimately settled on a gallery-led journey that simulated a sense of being enveloped by night. From within the gallery, a user could view, read the story behind the image and purchase a print. Other journeys we chose not to pursue were a map-based experience that showed shooting locations and relevant images taken at that location - although it fulfilled a common user query about where to go, it wasn't meaningful enough for many users who are not based in Western Australia.

### Sketches on paper

Sketching major parts of the site with pencil and paper allowed me to quickly iterate design ideas and user flows. Without getting attached to any idea, I could critically think through them before selecting options to pursue.

{% include image.html caption="Sketching options for a shop page" url="/assets/shopWireframes.jpg" alt="Wireframes and sketches for shop pages" %}

### Wireframes and mock ups on Sketch

I used Sketch to create higher fidelity mock ups, testing if ideas would work practically like juxtaposing text against the star-speckled images.

{% include image.html caption="Wireframes to further explore layouts for the gallery" url="/assets/galleryWireframeSketch.jpg" alt="Wireframes of the gallery" %}

I made a conscious decision to create wireframes in Sketch itself rather than in other programs like Axure or Balsamiq to critically think about elements on the page and to streamline the workflow rather than using different software for different purposes. I was also able to view changes and evolution of the design all in one document. (Moving forward though, I am keen to explore wireframing kits like the Wixel plugin).

## TESTING

I quickly created clickable prototypes in InVision to start testing on users. There were two main areas I was unsure of:

* Whether users would understand how to navigate through the images
* Whether users would find the purchasing process and workshop sign ups easy to follow

### Online shop: Conforming to conceptual models
Research showed that only after people have followed the photographer and looked at images for a while would they even consider purchasing a print. This is opposed to the behavior of browsing or window shopping which sees a person enter with an intent to compare and purchase. We designed for this behavior by locating the purchase process flow in a zoomed-in image (below), meaning that a user had specifically intended to find out more about an image.

![Beginning the purchase process](/assets/zoomedGalleryPurchase.jpg)

Despite this behavior, preliminary testing showed that at a glance, users didn't realise they could purchase things on this site at all. It lacked indicators. The navigation and design didn't fit the mental model of an online store.

I fixed this by adding a shop page and altered the navigation to make 'Shop’ clearly signify the ability to purchase something. On hindsight, this design change felt obvious and further testing showed that users found the new navigation clearer about the functions of the site.

### Increasing gallery visibility and constraints
For the vast majority of users, the main thing they want to do is to look at images. I met this “80% use case” by getting straight to business with the gallery as the homepage.

User testing however, uncovered a design flaw. I watched how users hesitated or tried clicking into other pages when they landed on the site, unclear that there was a treasure trove of images below if they simply scrolled down.

I solved this problem by simply increasing visibility of the gallery and constraints on the user flow, adding a downward arrow to lead users down the path.

The changes to the gallery and shop felt obvious and improved the flow significantly. Other than that, user testing uncovered no major problems. It confirmed the flow that users browse and only decide to purchase after viewing an image.
