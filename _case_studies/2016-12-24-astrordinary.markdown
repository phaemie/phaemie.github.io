This was a side project I took on with my brother. He created Astrordinary in 2015 to photograph and share high-resolution panoramas and VR photospheres of the Milky Way galaxy and near space as seen from Western Australia. It resonated with many and a community soon grew organically. The website needed an overhaul to better meet user needs. In addition, a new need quickly arose as people requested to purchase prints.

## Themes

I began a need-finding mission by reading every single post, question and comment left by users to gain a sense of what individuals wanted from this community. I researched their motivations for viewing or purchasing images, sending messages and sharing posts.

Through research, some themes quickly became apparent and proto-personas emerged. Many people became part of the community for the following main reasons.

### 1. Appreciating natural beauty

Many were drawn to the raw, natural beauty of the night sky captured in the images. This appreciation was personal and highly emotional; looking at the magnificent Milky Way images often surfaced a nostalgic memory (such as of childhood and how the sky looked when a person lived at a certain house) or an emotional memory of doing or a desire to do something with a loved one.

### 2. Improving technical learning

These images inspired many amateurs and photographers alike to learn more about photography techniques, equipment and shooting locations. People were interested in the background of how the images were taken.

### 3. A sense of adventure

Many felt compelled to go out there and experience the world through activities like camping, stargazing and road trips after viewing these images. They also sought connection with others through meetups to go on photoshoots.

## Reframing the problem

With the themes and user motivations in mind, we expanded our design challenge with the aim of immersing a person in the experience of the night sky and astrophotography. 

The themes enabled us to make design and content decisions with users in mind. For example, user research showed that a major group of people were keen to learn more about photography techniques. We brainstormed win-win solutions that gave users what they want, while making sense for a small business. This ultimately resulted in freely sharing information about equipment and developing workshops that interested people could sign up to.

We tossed around a few user journeys and ultimately settled on a gallery-led journey that simulated a sense of being enveloped by night. From within the gallery, a user could view, read the story behind the image and purchase a print. 

## The process

We started iterating quickly through rough sketches and wireframes, throwing out design ideas for the UI and critiquing them without getting attached to any one idea. We decided on several promising sketches to pursue further.

I then used Sketch to create higher fidelity mock ups, also testing if UI designs would work practically like juxtaposing text against the star-speckled images.

## User testing

Next, I created interactive prototypes in InVision to test the designs. There were two main questions I wanted answered. On both accounts, we uncovered major learnings that allowed us to iterate meaningfully before build.

### 1. Can users successfully purchase a print or sign up for a workshop? 

We had assumed that people only purchased prints after they've followed the photographer and the images for a while, which resulted in us placing the purchase flow within a zoomed-in image (below). Our reasoning was that the user had shown interest in that image and intended to find out more about it.

Testing, however, showed that users often missed it. In fact, they didn't immediately realise they could purchase anything on this site at all! The navigation and design didn't fit the mental model of an online store.

I iterated on this issue by adding a dedicated shop page and worked on the navigation to make 'Shop’ prominent. On hindsight, this design change felt obvious and further testing showed that users found the new navigation clearer about the functions of the site.

### 2. Would users understand how to navigate through the gallery images?

For the vast majority of users, the main thing they want to do is to look at images. I met this “80% use case” by getting straight to business with the gallery as the homepage.

User testing however, uncovered a design flaw. I watched how users hesitated or tried clicking into other pages when they landed on the site, unclear that they would see more images if they simply scrolled down. I solved this problem by simply adding a downward arrow, indicating what to do.

The changes to the gallery and shop signficantly strengthened the design and flows, offering users many ways to experience the joys of the night sky.
