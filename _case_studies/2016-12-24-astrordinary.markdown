## MY ROLE AND THE TEAM

This was a major side project I took on with my brother.  I served as a UX and UI designer, in charge of the experience of the site. This included research, wireframing and prototyping. My brother fulfilled the product manager role and we both performed user testing.

## THE CHALLENGE

My brother created Astrordinary in 2015 to photograph high-resolution panoramas of the Milky Way and near space as seen from Western Australia. He initially shared these panoramas on a Facebook page and virtual reality 360 degree photospheres with Facebook 360 and Google Street View 360. Virtual reality was going mainstream. No surprise then that many people loved and shared the images, as did tourism organisations, photography pages and virtual reality apps and pages. Soon and the community of ‘earthlings’ grew organically to over 4000 within a year, concentrated on social media.

Apart from viewing images, some had requested to purchase prints and a website with a gallery and online store was setup to quickly meet this demand. I proposed that we work together to build a site that would be a complete experience for users to browse images, easily purchase prints and get more involved in astrophotography.

## THE APPROACH (Research, philosophies, ideation models)

### Keeping communication open
We were based in different ends of the country, so we made an extra effort to maintain open communication. We caught up via video chat to discuss thoughts, approaches and design critiques approximately once a week. We started in October 2016 with an approximate 4 month target to get the new site up and running.


### Getting inspiration
The Revamped Double Diamond framework was highly applicable to this project, helping to identify the right thing to design and then designing it right.

I was fired up and quickly got to work. I scanned the competitive landscape to learn about the online presences of other photographers especially those dealing with strong visual subject matter (like astrophotographers and landscape photographers). I also looked into what the user wanted, investigating areas like emotional states when viewing images and motivators for why people purchased images, sent a message, shared a post and what they did with their purchase.

### User empathy: Looking at virtual reality images and going for an astrophotography shoot
I followed every single post and looked at virtual reality images of Astrordinary shots using a VR headset. One thing I wasn't able to do that would have enhanced UX discovery was the chance to tag along and experience an astrophotography shoot in person. My one and only chance while on a short visit to Perth didn’t pan out; the night was cloudy and unsuitable for night photography. Oh well.

## DISCOVERY (Personas, problem framing, empathy with users, emotional states)

3 main reasons why people like Astrordinary images

#### 1. A sense of adventure
Upon looking at the images, many users mentioned activities like camping, stargazing and road trips. Many of these comments had a ‘carpe diem’ type of ethos. Many people expressed interest in meeting up to go on photoshoots and users enjoyed the sense of vicariously going on a night astro shoot.

#### 2. Learning
These images also inspired many to learn more about techniques, equipment and where to go.

#### 3. Beauty that invokes a sense of nostalgia
Many expressed appreciation for the raw, natural beauty of the night sky captured in the images. This appreciation was personal and highly emotional. Looking at the magnificent Milky Way images often surfaced a nostalgic memory (such as of childhood and how the sky looked when a person lived at a certain house) or an emotional memory of doing or desire to do something with a loved one.

Given the growing VR landscape, it’s not surprising that virtual reality 360 images were the most popular. They were shared by individuals, virtual reality apps/sites and tourism boards.

Armed with this discovery, I painted a picture of the user using four personas.

On a side note, adding insight from overheard conversations provided unsolicited insight that helped create a life-like persona. But on hindsight, I see that the profiles these personas painted was thin and could benefit from additional insight, even making the persona tell its own story (such as through speech bubbles).

## THE DESIGN PROBLEM, REFRAMED

Create a way that allows a person to experience the night sky and astrophotography.

This expanded the scope and possibilities from the initial goal of designing a photography portfolio.

## SKETCHES AND PROTOTYPES (tools used, user testing, fixes/refinement)

### Creating meaning for the user
The personas played a crucial role in our decisions designing an experience for them. We wanted to give the user what they wanted in the shortest amount of time possible. What we didn’t want was to design something unique but unmeaningful just to stand out from the homogeneity of design.

We also used the personas to guide us in the content audit and developing new content. For example, user research showed that a major group of users were keen to learn more about techniques. We discussed win-win solutions that gave users what they want in a way that made business sense. This ultimately resulted in freely sharing information about equipment and developing panorama workshops that interested users (like the Active learner) could sign up to.

We tossed around a few user journeys and ultimately settled on a gallery-led journey that simulated a sense of being enveloped by night. From within the gallery, a user could view, read the story behind the image and purchase a print. Other journeys we chose not to pursue were a map-based experience that showed shooting locations and relevant images taken at that location - although it fulfilled a common user query about where to go, it wasn't meaningful enough for many users who are not based in Western Australia.

### Interface sketches
Building the interface followed the flow: sketch > wireframe > prototype > code.

### Sketches on paper

Sketching major parts of the site with pencil and paper allowed me to quickly iterate design ideas and user flows. Without getting attached to any idea, I could critically think through them before selecting options to pursue.

### Wireframes on Sketch

I used Sketch for creating higher fidelity mock ups, testing if ideas would work practically like juxtaposing text against images.

I made a conscious decision to create wireframes in Sketch itself rather than in other programs like Omnigraffle or Balsamiq to critically think about elements on the page and to streamline the workflow rather than using different software for different purposes. I was also able to view changes and evolution of the design all in one document. (Moving forward, I am keen to use plugins like Wixel to help with wireframing).

## TESTING
===> [screenshot of mock ups in Invision]

I used InVision to test the mock ups. There were two main areas I was unsure of:

* Whether users would understand how to navigate through the gallery
* Whether users would find the purchasing process and workshop sign ups easy to follow

### Online shop: Conforming to conceptual models
Research showed that only after people have looked at images would they even consider purchasing a print. This is opposed to the behavior of browsing or window shopping which sees a person enter with an intent to compare and purchase. We designed for this behavior by locating the purchase process flow in a zoomed image, meaning that a user had specifically intended to find out more about an image.

![Beginning the purchase process](/assets/zoomedGalleryPurchase.jpg)

Despite this behavior, preliminary testing showed that at a glance, users didn't realise they could purchase things on this site at all. It was lacking any indicators; the navigation and design didn't fit a conceptual model of an online store. I fixed this by adding a shop page and altered the navigation to make 'Shop’ clearly signify the ability to purchase something. On hindsight, this design change felt obvious and further testing showed that users found the new navigation clearer as to the functions of the site.

### Increasing gallery visibility and constraints
For the vast majority of users, the first thing they want to do is to look at images. I met this “80% use case” by getting straight to business with the gallery as the homepage. However, from user testing, I watched how users used the site and uncovered that they weren’t clear on what to do when they landed on the page. Instead of browsing images, some began to click into other pages from the navigation. I solved this problem by increasing the visibility of the gallery, adding a call to action button to increase constraints on what to do.

The changes to the gallery and shop felt obvious and improved the flow significantly. Other than that, user testing uncovered no major problems. It confirmed the flow that users browse and only decide to purchase after viewing an image.
