## BACKGROUND
I designed and ran Two Rags from 2013-2016, an eCommerce site for women’s clothing that helped improve women’s health in India. I spent significant time prototyping, developing and manufacturing the physical product. During that time, I created a simple website to inform potential customers about the mission and increase mailing list sign ups. Around the time the product went into production, the site was due for a redesign into a full-fledged eCommerce site to connect do-gooders with those in need.

### Details
Time: around 4 weeks

Tools: Axure, Photoshop, Sketch, UserTesting.com, Google Docs, Optimal Sort

Techniques: Competitive analysis, Open card sorting, User flows, User scenarios, Use cases, Analytics review, Surveys, User journey mapping, Site mapping, Wireframing, Rapid prototyping, Content auditing, User testing, Lean UX

My role: I was the UX and UI designer. I also took full responsibility for content and images. A developer managed the technical aspects of building the site in Magento. 

## GOALS
The redesign was to result in a user-focused eCommerce site that connected shoppers with the people they helped, while also designing for business goals. 

* Reflect the mission and the charitable spirit of the company
* Showcase the products attractively
* A simple purchasing process

## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS AND USER RESEARCH

I started with the assumption that for a mission-led product, storytelling is of utmost importance. Talking about how the product helps those in need enables customers to see and feel their impact. As a result, they feel more engaged and happier with their experience. 

I got moving validating my assumption through a variety of methods: 

* Competitive analysis of other social commerce businesses, studying and comparing how they humanise commercial products
* Customer interviews
* Surveys
* Insight into customer behavior and motivations gathered from mailing lists, social media and analytics 
* Talking to potential customers about the product to see what about it interested them qualitatively

## CARD SORTING

Through Optimal Sort, I used open card sorting to gain insight into how users grouped content to help define a high level site map. Card sorting results suggested a narrow and deep site structure that corresponded with clear delineations between commercial and charity components. The main challenge I faced here was further sorting through content groups into subgroups in a site map, and in labelling them informatively that users would easily understand. I didn't finalise the site map until later in the process.

## PERSONAS
I began filling out personas based on profiles of customers who had followed the company. The main purpose of these personas was to keep customers in mind when designing and understand what made them tick (their goals, motivations and frustrations).

## CONTENT AND SITE AUDIT
Using analytics, I was able to audit existing content into reuse, rework and discard groups, which helped tremendously in creating useful content aligned with the new site structure.

## TASK ANALYSIS, USER FLOWS AND USER SCENARIOS
To identify scenarios and problems from a user's point of view, I performed a task analysis which helped define various user flows. I then mapped out flows for different scenarios, such as a user who wants to browse products but not buy anything yet, a user who wants to find out what impact his/her purchase might have before shopping for products, and a user who wants to purchase a product (below).

## SITE MAP
By this point, previous work in card sorting, user flows and content audit helped me create a site map. I still had a few questions about labelling, and wanted to test different labels with users.

## DESIGN IDEATION

### Sketches and wireframes
I had begun sketching page information architecture while working on the user flows and proceeded to create adaptive wireframes in Axure for the main pages. During this process, I constantly thought about the user's motivations, pain points and what might be preventing him or her from proceeding to the next step. 

### Prototyping
Speed was of the essence in order to get user feedback, so I turned to rapid prototyping turning the wireframes into interactive prototypes in Axure. Ready for testing!

## TESTING

With a prototype of the main pages, I went through two rounds of testing. Each time I got 5 users to test for: 

* usability 
* user flows
* A/B tests (such as for labels and taxonomy)

### Some results from testing
* Users preferred the label "Our Mission" over "What we do", and "Our Impact" over "How we help". They reported that "Our Mission" and "Our Impact" were stronger and and less ambiguous labels.
* The narrow and deep site map made sense with users, with the shop and mission sections forming the core of the site. Many users switched between the two sections easily.
* Users were divided on a compare functionality (some wanted it but others thought that with only 3 styles, comparing seemed redundant)
* Users found the existing site's zoom functionality hard to use (the zoom feature consisted of a magnifying glass-like bubble that allowed the user to zoom into parts of the product image). The first wireframes didn't have a zoom functionality, which many users pointed out.

## VISUAL DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
Following testing, I worked on the visual design of the site to tell the story of the product and company. Versions of the site were live from 2013 to mid 2016.
