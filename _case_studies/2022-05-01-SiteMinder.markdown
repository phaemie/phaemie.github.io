## SiteMinder Product Design

Recently I've been working on the newly-lanched SiteMinder Property Platform, an e-commerce platform that provides the tools and knowledge for hoteliers to run successful businesses. The team is great and the work is challenging.

Day-to-day, my role is to improve the experience of the platform, ensuring that its parts work in a consistent and cohesive manner.

## Some highlights so far

### Platform notifications and messaging
An improved framework for how customers receive and manage their preferences for notifications and messaging.

### A billing portal
I designed, tested and delivered a self-service billing portal for the SaaS platform, giving customers an overview of their invoicing and transactional history for the first time.

### The login and multi-factor authentication experience
An improved platform login and multi-factor authentication process that aligns with the new SiteMinder design system while providing added security.

### Customer journey mapping
I was part of the core team to discover customer journey touchpoints, key moments and pain points, from onboarding all the way to offboarding.
