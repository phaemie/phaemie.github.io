## THE CHALLENGE
In recent years, there have been several studies (like [this one](https://www.unicef.org/wash/schools/files/4_UNICEF_Rajashi_PPT_(Final).pdf)) around the state of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) in India. It’s hard to objectively quantify a sensitive topic like women’s health and each study produced different but overlapping statistics. But the gist was clear. Menstrual hygiene practices were generally poor and often showed strong correlations with socioeconomic factors. 

Studies explored taboos, practices, coping mechanisms and health impacts of poor menstrual hygiene management on such a large scale (there are over 300 million women with periods in India). The main barriers identified included difficulty accessing disposable pads (due to cost, availability or cultural practices), lack of toilets and cleaning facilities like running water and rudimentary disposal systems. There was even talk about girls skipping school during their periods due to stress and embarrassment. Other practical problems included washing and drying soiled clothing and sanitary products discreetly, in a body of water (no washing machine!).

## THE APPROACH
There are so many moving parts to this problem that I doubt one solution can fix them all. Some solutions relied on improving infrastructure like bathrooms, sewage and refuse collection. Others relied on education and tackling specific social and cultural practices. It was beyond my ability to solve everything.

Nonetheless I gave it a go to design a solution for part of it. In a large and diverse country like India, it’s impossible to make sweeping generalisations about the user so I approached this problem on a community-level, finding a solution for managing within the system. 

## DISCOVERY

### Expert interviews and secondary research
I researched and approached NGOs, startups and organisations dealing in similar areas who might have insight and context. Each focused on a different group of people, so it’s no wonder they had different solutions and takes on the problem such as creating a curriculum that teaches schoolgirls about their biological functions.

### Group interview (survey) and primary research
To provide a snapshot of a community, I commissioned a survey of 100 girls and women in a rural village in Bengal. I had a local lady find out about habits, product/s used and reasons for doing so. After each interview, the participant was thanked with some chocolate. The results showed that most people used cloth like old torn up sari as they were cost effective, and expressed genuine interest in using pads. 

The main challenge I found in conducting primary research was finding ways to overcome cultural differences, such as overcoming the polite barrier to get users to speak honestly. 

### Analogous inspiration: Modern cloth diapers
To explore ideas on creating a high-absorbency product, I looked at an analogous example of modern cloth diapers. My memory of cloth nappies was a single sheet of cloth secured by a large safety pin. But cloth nappies have come a long way since, resembling disposable nappies in design with bells and whistles like inserts, waterproof linings and adjustable sizes.  

### Pulling things together
Ideally I would have also included methods like immersion into the community, guided tours of the user’s home and school environment and photojournaling. However, I was unable to travel at the time and had to make do with conducting research from Australia. 

Together with studies, the information I gathered from the discovery phase helped me hone in on constraints:

* Create something that can be reused or disposed of in a way that minimises pollution, knowing that disposal amenities can be scarce
* Create a way to handle a soiled product, given inadequate disposal systems and/or taking a soiled product home to wash


## PROTOTYPING

{% include image.html caption="Trying out different shapes and patterns" url="/assets/EarlyPrototypes.jpg" alt="Early prototypes for a reusable pad" %}

I thought about a few ideas like creating low-cost disposable pads made from recycled waste and biodegradable pads. But these solutions didn't confront both the problems of supply and disposal. Nothing stuck as well as an obvious solution did; a reusable fabric sanitary pad. Easy to make and long lasting. A washable pad built on these girls’ mental models of using, washing and reusing cloth and a desire for using sanitary pads to manage their periods.

I quickly tested and selected fabrics that were quick drying and absorbent. I tested a variety of layers and materials before creating a prototype consisting of layers of terry (like a towel) and a top layer of flannelette.

### Product first, then features
For the [product-solution-fit](https://medium.com/@jaf_designer/why-product-thinking-is-the-next-big-thing-in-ux-design-ee7de959f3fe#.kxuagv8i6), I thought about the core experience first; make managing periods in rural areas easy. I then explored different features that would help extend the core experience into a delightful one.

* Reusable after washing. This feature dealt with supply, eliminating the need to spend money/time procuring new disposable ones.
* A modular system with shells and inserts. This feature optimised for quick drying and flexibility in the degree of absorbency.
* A foldable shell for discreetly transporting soiled pads for washing later.
* Discreet pouch to contain clean and soiled pads.

### Testing
I iterated on the prototypes till I got a pattern and combination of materials in layers that I felt comfortable to test. I tested out this combination:

I created a few prototypes to send out to volunteers to test over a few months and report to me how they worked. User testing returned feedback that the cloth pads and inserts were comfortable and absorbent. Some noted that it was even a beautiful product too. 

One area of feedback to fix was that the snaps were weak and after a few uses, some of the snaps loosened, rendering the entire pad useless. This wasn't too alarming. For the prototypes, the snaps had been applied by hand and hammer but for production, stronger snaps would be machine-applied.

## LEARNINGS AND REFLECTION

Apart from the snaps, I got good feedback about the design, form and function of the prototypes. However, when requesting quotes for production and distribution, the unit costs were high due to small scale production. I explored pivoting to make an impact partnering with other organisations that had a presence and service in their various communities.

_**Note:** Ultimately I decided not to manufacture this product due to costs, but nonetheless this challenge was rich in learning, risk and experimentation. Through this challenge I was able to apply a design thinking methodology to prototype a physical product that solved a real world problem, improving my product thinking skillset as a more well-rounded UX designer._
