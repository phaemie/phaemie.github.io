Hi there, I’m Phaemie. I’m a UX designer based in Sydney, Australia.

A little about how I got into UX design: as a digital producer, a huge part of my role was to translate complex business requirements into web products and features while keeping things simple for the user. I experimented with many ways, like putting on my 'user hat’ (empathy) when wireframing, listening to feedback and taking iterative action to improve the online user experience.

When it comes to process, I approach problems using methods like the double diamond and IDEO’s human centered design. I have also designed and shipped a number of side projects that delve deeper into user problems and solving them in a way that is delightful and thoughtful. 

I am excited about design and creating things together. Drop me a line to chat further.
