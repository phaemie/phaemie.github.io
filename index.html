                I have 8 years experience with the web, in various roles. I started my career in 2008 as a content specialist for Artnet.com in NY, and had a clothing startup named Scarfu.com on the side. In 2010, I moved to Australia where I worked for Vivid Wireless as their Content Producer managing agencies and ushering through branding updates and UX improvements over the next 3 years. I attempted another clothing startup called Two Rags, this time specializing in underwear. Two Rags was a social enterprise that provided a woman a set of reusable menstrual pads and menstrual hygiene education with every pair of underwear we sold. We've already' provided over 600 women with pads and education, but after having my first child, I decided to focus on my family for a while and shut down TwoRags.
                Now I'm looking for a role in a team of smart, passionate people who, like DHH of Basecamp, understand that success is about working smarter, not longer hours.
